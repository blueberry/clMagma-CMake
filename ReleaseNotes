             clMAGMA Release Notes

-----------------------------------------------------

clMAGMA is an OpenCL port of MAGMA. It supports AMD GPUs. 

Routines are included for the following algorithms:

    * LU, QR, and Cholesky factorizations, with multi-GPU support
    * Hessenberg, bidiagonal, and tridiagonal reductions
    * Linear solvers based on LU, QR, and Cholesky
    * Eigenvalue and singular value problem solvers
    * Orthogonal transformation routines.

Most routines have all four precisions:
single (s), double (d), single-complex (c), double-complex (z).

 1.1.0 - 11-18-2013
    * Performance improvements
    * Add LU, QR, and Cholesky factorizations and solvers with CPU interfaces
    * Add multi-buffer LU, QR, and Cholesky factorizations that overcome size 
      limitations for single memory allocation, enabling the solution of large 
      problems
    * Add multiGPU implementations for the LU, QR, and Cholesky factorizations.
    * Add 'make shared' target to make a shared library.

 1.0.0 - 10-24-2012
    * Add eigen and singular value problem solvers in both real and
      complex arithmetic, single and double (routines magma_z|c}heevd,
      magma_{d|s}syevd, magma_{z|c|d|s}geev, and magma_{z|c|d|s}gesvd) ;
    * Add matrix inversion routines (routines magma_{z|c|d|s}trtri_gpu,
      magma_{z|c|d|s}getri_gpu, magma_{z|c|d|s}potri_gpu);
    * Add orthogonal transformations routines ({z|c}unmqr_gpu,
      {d|s}ormqr_gpu, {z|c}ungqr, {d|s}orgqr, {z|c}unmtr, {d|s}ormtr,
      {z|c}unmqr, {d|s}ormqr, {z|c}unmql, {d|s}ormql, {z|c}unghr,
      and {d|s}orghr).

 0.3.0 - 06-29-2012
    * Reduction to upper Hessenberg form by similarity orthogonal 
      transformations (routines magma_{z|c|d|s}gehrd )
    * Reduction to upper/lower bidiagonal form by similarity orthogonal 
      transformations (routines magma_{z|c|d|s}gebrd )
    * Reduction to tridiagonal form by similarity orthogonal transformations
      ( routines magma_{zhe|che|dsy|ssy}trd )

 0.2.0 - 05-26-2012
    * Change GPU_TARGET in make.inc to descriptive name (e.g., AMD).
    * Added solvers for general and symmetric matrices 
    * Added least squares solver
    * Added multiple precision support for LU factorization
    * All routines provided in this release support s/d/c/z 
      precision arithmetic

 0.1.0 - 04-04-2012
    * LU, QR, and Cholesky dense matrix factorizations
    * Auxiliary OpenCL kernels
